By day, I work at [Botek](https://www.botek.se) in my lovely little [hometown](https://ulricehamn.se/kontakt/english/), where I lead web development projects and oversee documentation, as well as help out where I can, often related to design, usability, and accessibility.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing <i>(a lot of)</i> video games, read books and comics, watching animated shows and movies, spending time outdoors, and trying to write and expand my own &ldquo;literary universe&rdquo; when I can.
