Outside of my regular duties at Botek, I'm also one of those who gladly pores over and writes documentation for a lot of our hardware and software, both for internal and external use.

To simplify further development, maintenance, and sharing of the documentation within and outside of Botek, we are currently in the process of implementing a <i>Wiki</i> system for all of this.
