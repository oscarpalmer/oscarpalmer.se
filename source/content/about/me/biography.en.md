I grew up in [Ulricehamn](https://ulricehamn.se), a nice little town by a lake with a lot of opportunities for sports, but I was always more interested in tech-related things – like computers and video games – since my early teen years, which has only continued into &ldquo;adulthood&rdquo;.

At 16, I started designing small icons and docks <i>(for macOS)</i>, as well as developing small websites for myself. The forum <i>MacThemes</i> was then a big inspiration and interest portal for me, and I see it as a springboard for my interests in design and development, as well as a great place to meet new, cool friends.

After high school <i>(well, gymnasium)</i>, I both studied and worked: I tried studying real programming in Linköping, but dropped out before finishing anything. This was followed by a handful of odd jobs, including one at <a href="https://seger.se" hreflang="sv">Seger</a> where I knitted socks.

I went back to school in 2016, this time at [HB](https://www.hb.se/en), where my studies covered project management, design and interaction, and programming and systems development. Before I was able to graduate <i>(and then never found the time for)</i>, I signed a contract with <i>Botek</i> and have been there since.

I am not well-traveled – and often feel quite content with just being at home – but thanks to the friends one has met online, all the pop culture one has consumed, as well as a small interest in sports, there are a few places I would like to visit, e.g., Barcelona, California, Japan, Manchester, and New York… maybe some day…
