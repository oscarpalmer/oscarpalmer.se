How nice that you find this interesting, because I do too, of course! <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ˜Š</span>

The content on this page is mostly written in {{markdown}}, while I write page templates using {{liquid}}.

The stylesheets are written in {{sass}}, but &ldquo;regular <i>CSS</i>&rdquo; has come a long way since I started with web development, and I might be able to leave <i>Sass</i> soon.

The icons used on the page are either reliable emojis or fetched from {{tabler}}.

I write and develop everything in {{nova}} <i>(or {{vscode}})</i> and test it <i>(primarily)</i> in {{polypane}}, all on [an iMac](https://www.apple.com/imac/).

To bundle all the source files together, I use {{eleventy}} â€“ which is a great and extensible static site generator â€“ together with {{bun}} as a build tool.

The site is hosted on {{cloudflare}}, but I have previously used {{digitalocean}}â€¦ and I'm sure I'll be back there soon. The domain name is provided via {{iwantmyname}}.

Missing anything? [Let me know](/en/contact/), or check out [the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/oscarpalmer/oscarpalmer.se). <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ¤“</span>
