I am a designer and developer, with an interest in usability and accessibility, especially on the web.

Job titles and their responsibilities are always a bit fuzzy, especially in smaller development teams, but I would like to call myself a design or interface engineer, as I can lead and participate in work from concept to prototypes, prototypes to implementation, as well as evaluation and documentation of all results.

By day, I work at [Botek](https://www.botek.se/en/), where I lead <i>(and support)</i> the development of web-related products, help in all design processes, and write documentation for all sorts of things.

When I'm not working, my eyes are often glued to various screens anyway, preferably with a game controller in hand, but I also like to read books and comics, watch football and wrestling, write my own little stories, as well as clear my mind out in nature.
