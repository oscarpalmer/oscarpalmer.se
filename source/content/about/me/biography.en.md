I grew up in [Ulricehamn](https://ulricehamn.se), a nice little town by a lake with a lot of opportunities for sports, but I was always more interested in tech-related things – like computers and video games – since my early teen years, which has only continued into "adulthood".

At 16, I started designing small icons and docks <i>(for macOS)</i>, as well as developing small websites for myself. The forum <i>MacThemes</i> was then a big inspiration and interest portal for me, and I see it as a springboard for my interests in design and development, as well as a great place to meet new, cool friends.

After high school, I moved to Linköping to study programming for real, but I wasn't quite ready for it and chose to drop out before I could finish my studies. I then moved back to Ulricehamn and worked here and there, before I realized that I actually want to work with design and development for real.

I then started studying at [Högskolan i Borås](https://www.hb.se), where my studies covered a lot regarding project management, design and interaction, as well as programming and system development. Unfortunately, it went so well that I signed a contract with <i>Botek</i> before I even graduated, and I have been working there ever since.

I am not well-traveled – and often feel quite content with just being at home – but thanks to the friends one has met online, all the pop culture one has consumed, as well as a small interest in sports, there are a few places I would like to visit: Barcelona, California, Manchester, and Tokyo… maybe some day…
